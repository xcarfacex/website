"With the advancements of today's technology, cyber security is a big problem we have in society not just on an individual level but also a national level as Americans.

								<p>"AI offers a solution that matches the gravity of the problem, Unlike humans, that are limited by time, resources, and basic human error . AI operates continuously and without fatigue, It can monitor millions of data points at the same time . It can trace potential threats and neutralize them in seconds. When dealing with cyberattacks that are bound to happen a lot more in the near future. AI isnt just an option it's essential."

									"Although AI does have its ethical risk in cyber security like Over reliance on automation, the truth is Ai is only as ethical as the people who program it. In cybersecurity Ai is not an aware agent, it's a tool designed by humans to detect , fight and prevent cyber threats . Any ethical problems can be solved by proper understanding and safe practices. To conclude Ai in cyber security is like our version of the great awaken so donâ€™t fight in embarrass it. My names Dewitt and I agree with this message."
