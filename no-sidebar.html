									<h2>Whats Our Take?</h2>
									
								</header>
								<p>
									We believe that AI should be integrated into cybersecurity. We believe that if set up and maintained properly,  AI will improve a lot in the coming year. Because of AI’s abilities of analysis, speed, and decisionmaking, we think it can make a big difference. AI will speed the process of finding vulnerabilities and patching them which is huge. AI will also be able to provide deep analysis of systems and data we want quickly as well. Today one huge factor that impacts our cyber security is our speed of analyzing data and systems to find vulnerabilities.   

									However, this is only possible if these AI systems are programmed and maintained properly. Many have concerns about AI’s ability to malfunction or make mistakes. The solution to this is easy, take more time to ensure your program is correctly coded. Today many flaws in cybersecurity programs lead to exploitations because of the carelessness of programmers. These systems will work amazingly only if they are constructed properly. Regularly updating and maintaining these systems are a must because of their capabilities and power. Overall, We believe AI is the future of cybersecurity but it's only possible if the necessary work is done for these AI systems to function properly and efficiently.
