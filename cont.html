									<h2>Controversy Of AI In Cybersecurity</h2>
									
								</header>
								<p>
									Today AI is a big controversy in cybersecurity because of its power and capabilities. AI can be a powerful asset, but it could also be a big threat in the cybersecurity world. AI can not only identify threats quickly but also respond and defend against them. AI can also analyze lots of data patterns very quickly and get data results out as well. However, AI can also be a big threat to us if used by the wrong hands. Cybercriminals can use and program AI as well, creating faster and more lethal attacks. Today many Like the Idea of AI assisting for positive reasons, but they are scared that it will end up in the wrong hands.


									Another reason many are concerned about AI is how trustworthy and reliable AI actually is. Many wonder about the severity of the consequences if our own AI systems get hacked or malfunctions. Many ponder that since AI has a mind of its own, will it attack the systems it is supposed to defend? AI in cyber security can be very beneficial but has its risks. But still trying to balance its positives and negatives, is why AI in cybersecurity is such a controversial topic today
